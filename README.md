# Project description:
# As a group, the rpg project is interesting to us because we like the idea of the user making choices that are unique
# to their own experience of the game via different scenarios. We also very much like rpg games like Final Fantasy
# as they can let players immerse themselves through interactive storytelling that makes the medium distinctive from others.

# We plan on coding the project in C++ and will be using GitHub to document it.

# The input of the project will be player commands that perform different actions. The output will show the decisions
# you can make in game and the scenarios you are in. A narrative will be displayed and you will be able to attack, run,
# access your inventory, or use a heal item. A feature of the program will be the ability to select a character that will
# have different types of weapons and armor. In the program there will be a variety of enemies to fight, each with their own stats and dialouge.
